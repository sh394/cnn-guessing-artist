# cnn-guessing-artist
This convolutional neural network model classifies the artist of a painting. The convolutional nerual network has been trained with paintings of well-known artist such as Jackson Pollock, Gustav Klimt and etc.

The convolutional neural network has been implemented and trained using TensorFlow 2.5. The model is constitued by a multi-layer convolutional neural network , which is followed by a fully connected layer and completed with a softmax readout layer.


Example output by Jackson Pollock
